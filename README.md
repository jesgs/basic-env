# Jess' Basic Dev Tools/Setup/Whatever

Some settings are geared towards a MacOS environment like KeyBindings (I prefer Windows/*nix binding for the home/end keys)
and Sublime Text user settings but can generally be used for any *nix environment.

### Tools to install:
* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
  * [Node Version Manager (NVM)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
  * [Rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv)
